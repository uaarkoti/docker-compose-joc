After the fixed period the job will automatically be re-enabled.
    This is usually useful in scenarios when teams are making a lot of changes that are known to make the repository unstable for a period of time. Instead of dealing with false errors, the job can be disabled and automatically woken up.</l:description></l:dependency></l:dependencies>
